# flutter-credit-card-wallet

**This is a Work in progress.**

The purpose of this app is to store all my debit and credit cards data to have them available at any time.

I'm currently using Mercado Pago and YPF's app as my default wallets for paying stuff and, usually, it asks me for the CVC code of a particular card before finalizing the payment.

Having this data stored in my mobile allows me to continue using my cards without carrying them all the time with me.

All the data is stored encrypted in the local storage and the app doesn't require internet access at all.
